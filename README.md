## Adaptive UI Patterns

Explorations following the evolving Adaptive UI sections of the Material Design spec. Please note that all of this work should be considered experimental. It is geared towards prototyping.

## What is Adaptive UI?

Responsive layouts in material design adapt to any possible screen size. Our [Adaptive UI](https://www.google.com/design/spec/layout/adaptive-ui.html) guidance includes a flexible grid that ensures consistency across layouts, breakpoint details about how content reflows on different screens, and a description of how an app can scale from small to extra-large screens.
